"At the Breaking Point: How Bus Operators Cope with Transit Technology Failures and What That Can Tell Us about the Integration of Future Innovations"

ABSTRACT
This paper examines the cascading effects of technical failures in transit, focusing on the challenges faced by bus operators when communication, passenger-facing, and mechanical technologies fail. Through a longitudinal diary study, we gather operator accounts of critical tools like radios, mobile data terminals (MDTs), payment systems, and ramps, alongside their failures. Issues like radio outages, GPS malfunctions, and broken fare systems lead to operational delays, safety risks, and increased stress. Triaging breakdowns becomes crucial to operations and drivers adapt by using personal phones in emergencies, highlighting gaps in system integration. As transit electrifies its fleets and considers a wider range of innovations, these failures offer key insights into the challenges ahead, emphasizing the need for robust, adaptable systems that ensure operational continuity and protect worker well-being amid rapid technological change.
INTRODUCTION
In Asheville, North Carolina, three electric buses sit idle at the city’s transit maintenance facility, emblematic of the challenges inherent in adopting advanced transit technologies [cite]. Purchased in 2018 with the promise of reducing emissions and modernizing the city’s transportation fleet, these buses now face persistent technical issues ranging from software glitches to broken components—exacerbated by the manufacturer’s bankruptcy [cite]. Meanwhile, the city’s remaining biodiesel and hybrid buses endure increased wear and tear, further straining maintenance resources. This scenario reflects a broader trend: the transition to innovative transit technologies often encounters unanticipated hurdles, raising critical questions about design, reliability, and the role of workers in ensuring safety and service continuity.

Proposals for the future of bus transit increasingly emphasize integrating advanced technologies, including autonomous driving systems, real-time data analytics for dynamic scheduling and route optimization, and the expansion of electrification. Smart infrastructure, deployed through connected traffic signals and dedicated bus lanes, aims to minimize delays, while mobile apps and AI-driven systems are being developed to provide personalized travel recommendations and expanded fare payment options. Proponents tout the potential of these technical interventions to make bus transit more competitive with private vehicles and better suited to modern urban mobility demands. However, the successful adoption of these innovations depends not only on their technical sophistication and realized capabilities but also on their alignment with the operational realities and maintenance practices of existing transit systems.

At the heart of transit operations are bus operators, whose indispensable role in providing safe and reliable transportation is often overlooked in discussions about technological advancement [cite Martelaro et al; Akridge et al; Prichard]. The existing technologies operators rely on today—communication, passenger-facing, and mechanical systems—are prone to malfunctions that undermine both service quality and safety. Drawing on a diary study of 93 bus operators across the United States and Canada, this research provides a longitudinal perspective on the types of malfunctions they encounter, the adaptive strategies they employ to remedy breakdowns, and the broader operational consequences. By focusing on firsthand worker accounts rather than technical reports or performance metrics, this study offers a unique lens through which to understand the lived experiences of operators and their critical insights into system design, safety, service, and reliability. Specifically, we examine the following research questions: 1) What technological malfunctions do bus operators experience on the job; 2) What are the consequences of these failures; and 3) What might existing malfunctions tell us about the implementation and evaluation of future technologies?

Bus operators frequently report issues with essential tools such as radio systems, mobile data terminals (MDTs), fare payment systems, and ramps. Failures in these systems—ranging from complete outages to intermittent disruptions—compromise real-time coordination, situational awareness, and decision-making. These breakdowns often lead to cascading operational inefficiencies, such as missed detour instructions, delayed responses to safety incidents, and heightened stress among operators. In response, some operators describe resorting to using personal cell phones as temporary workarounds, a practice that conflicts with policies prohibiting mobile phone use during operation. This disconnect highlights the need for further attention to the operational realities of today’s transit technologies and more worker-centered technology solutions.

Beyond accounting for current system breakdowns, this research underscores for the HCI community the importance of maintaining legacy systems as a foundation for the design and adoption of emergent transit technologies like fleet electrification and driver assistance systems [cite: Cohn]. Aging infrastructure and poorly maintained vehicles create operational instability that is regularly absorbed by frontline workers. Looking ahead, though the field’s sight may be fixed on emergent technologies, the need for existing communication and passenger facing technologies will remain. For example, the frequent mechanical and digital breakdowns operators face in traditional fleets may exacerbate reliability issues during the transition to electric buses, which require specialized maintenance, operational protocols (e.g., due to new capacity constraints), and charging infrastructure. Similarly, existing vehicles may lack compatibility with advanced driver assistance systems, undermining the potential benefits of retrofitting fleets. Furthermore, issues that occur on the bus while in service, such as mechanical failures or digital system outages, require adaptation plans to ensure that service can keep running despite degradation. Such workarounds could be considered in advance during new systems designs, however, there will be issues that require human intervention. By prioritizing worker-led integration and maintenance strategies, this research highlights the need for robust, adaptive transit technologies that enhance safety, reliability, and accessibility. In doing so, this work contributes to the development of resilient public transit systems capable of meeting the demands of urban mobility now and into the future.
BACKGROUND 
Municipal public transit systems within North America include fleets of heavy-duty 40-foot or 60-foot articulated buses operating on a network of routes throughout cities, suburban neighborhoods, and rural areas. Buses are typically diesel powered and may include articulated electrical power when running on routes with overhead power lines. Increasingly, North American transit companies are investing in new low-emission propulsion technologies powered by compressed natural gas or electric batteries. Recently, there have been billions of dollars in grants disbursed for electrification from the U.S. Federal Transit Administration (FTA). This is changing the face of aging bus fleets that may be over a decade old [cite]. 

Bus electrification is one of the largest technology shifts occurring in public transit today. Along with electric vehicles, new generations of buses often include forms of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). These changes together may have profound impacts on the day-to-day work of maintenance and the impact of technological breakdown. Buses are also being retrofitted with new technologies based on the evolving needs of bus operators and passengers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, air filtration systems and plastic shields were installed in buses to protect operators and passengers. Unfortunately, there has been a sharp rise in assaults on drivers [cite], prompting new cabin enclosure designs to protect drivers [cite]. Building on this, the Bus of the Future project [cite] proposed a variety of new technologies to protect drivers from assault, reduce driver injury and occupational hazards (such as improved seats and fresh air ventilation), and improve driver visibility and situation awareness around the road (such as better mirrors and computerized obstacle detection systems). These proposed changes include both physical designs and digital systems.

These changes are needed to help ensure a safe work environment and attract new workers to the profession. The experience of operating a transit bus is challenging and impacts workers and their retention (Wasserman et al. 2024). Many of the issues being addressed in the Bus of the Future Project highlight operators' issues, such as bodily strain due to poor ergonomics, respiratory issues due to diesel exhaust fumes, and assaults [cite bus of the future]. Due to these chronic issues and acute ones following the COVID-19 pandemic, there are staffing shortfalls of bus operators and mechanics [cite]. This leads to limited capacity for expanding service and maintaining existing bus fleets. Our paper describes many of the on the ground effects of this reality.

As with any operational change, the system design and implementation of technologies on buses can impact operators’ work. Each system, with its interfaces, controls, and sensors, presents a potential component whose failure can impact and degrade the bus service. As described in this paper, technological failures are managed by operators while en route. Often, operators and maintenance teams will develop strategies for managing technology issues, depending on the scale and severity of the issue or breakdown. Ultimately, transit operators work to continue service for their passengers despite issues. As new technologies such as electric vehicle propulsion systems, driver assistance, and automation are considered and eventually introduced, it will be critical for system designers and bus manufacturers to understand how current on the ground operations work and how transit operators interact with existing and emerging technologies. Beyond designing future systems, transportation companies, operators, and maintenance teams should consider how new technologies will impact their operational, maintenance, and repair procedures to ensure good service and good working conditions. Given this, our research aims to understand how operators experience current technologies in order to provide system designers with considerations for designing future transit innovations that acknowledge infrastructural realities and leverage worker expertise. 
RELATED WORK 
Emerging Transit Technologies and the Need for Operator Perspectives 
Previous work on public transit in DIS primarily focuses on passenger perspectives, such as inclusive design for passengers with accessibility needs [BusMyFriend, Accessibility and The Crowded Sidewalk] and the intersection of gender and mobility in the Global South [“Shotitwo First!”]. These studies aim to inform the design and integration of new technologies that improve user experience. Among these technologies, automation has received relatively more attention, with focus on new possibilities for public transit [“Shotitwo First!”]. Automation research often emphasizes rider perceptions as barriers to broader implementation and examines concerns about safety[], privacy[], and accessibility[], which align with broader priorities for mass transit. 
While many HCI studies explore speculative designs or conduct user studies of emerging passenger facing bus technologies [], far fewer consider worker perspectives. A notable exception is the work of Prichard et al. who examine the impact of digital transformations that happened in bus transit in the early 2010s [cite, cite, cite]. These researchers conducted ethnographically-oriented research with London bus drivers to understand the impact of three technologies: a driver performance monitoring software, location based services, and tap fare payment replacing cash. Pritchard et al. found that these practices fundamentally changed driving and customer service roles. For example, the introduction of location based services or GPS tracking allows management to track drivers’ real time progress and enforce tight schedules. This technology is integrated into a small terminal that displays their time status. While some drivers appreciated the additional information and the challenge of staying right on time, most drivers strongly disapproved of the change. For them, this technology decreased their autonomy and deskilled aspects of their work. Half of the drivers even made references to “Big Brother” watching over their shoulder. In their view, tracking enabled heightened surveillance and made driving a losing game. Researchers also point to negative consequences on some riders. With heightened time pressure some elderly and disabled passengers, who can take more time to service, were given a cold shoulder. Concerns were raised with the introduction of a driver performance monitoring software, “Drivewell.” While some drivers recognized the value of being able to monitor how smooth a ride they were providing passengers, most had complaints about the system. These range from the arbitrary way it scored drivers given how different buses perform to feeling uncomfortable being surveilled (“Big Brother” again) and having performance data extracted. It was also one more interface to monitor while also attending to road conditions and passengers. Similarly, Pritchard et al. describe how the introduction of a cashless payment system produced new work and driver concerns. Many drivers were appreciative of the way tap payment sped up the boarding process, but in the context of a transition found themselves re-explaining the system to riders repeatedly. They also raised concerns about privacy and populations harmed by the broader societal transition to cashless payment. Overall, these papers speak to the way digital technologies can enhance managerial control and reconfigure basic tasks. The bus operators in these studies were by and large concerned with the intrusive affordances of these technologies and “panopticon” like effect. To combat these harms Pritchard et al. have called for more worker participation in the design of role transforming technologies [Pritchard et al. 2015a (digitally driven)]. 
Our work follows this call and attends to other aspects of the empirical realities of use — namely technological breakdown and failure. We investigate these instances through direct operator experiences. Drawing on the foundational work of Perrow, Hollnagel & Woods, and Rasmussen, we offer analysis across multiple bus technologies to reflect the cascading nature of failure [Perrow 1984; Hollnagel et al 2006]; performance variability in human-machine teaming [Hollnagel & Woods, 2005]; and strategies of operator adaptation amidst operational constraints [Rasmussen 1997]. In doing so, we seek to inform future design, maintenance, and operations practices.
The Ongoingness of Technological Repair
The study of breakdown and repair has been a foundational area in HCI, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Science and Technology Studies (STS), emphasizing the labor involved in maintaining and restoring systems under conditions of technical failure [Rethinking Repair, cite, cite, cite]. Within CSCW, "articulation work" (Suchman, 1994) describes the additional efforts required to realign systems disrupted by design mismatches or external conditions. This lens has often been applied to new technologies, yet our focus shifts toward recurring breakdowns, particularly in transit contexts, where failures impact both operational safety and the immediate work of drivers.

The concept of "repairedness," introduced by Jung et al. (2021), foregrounds the negotiated state of "workingness" that artifacts achieve post-repair, emphasizing contingent stabilization rather than a binary state of functionality​. This idea intersects with work from Cohn et al. (2016) on "convivial decay," which describes the deliberate management of aging systems to ensure graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure. Such practices highlight repair not as simple restoration but as a sociotechnical negotiation shaped by the materiality and evolving demands on infrastructure​.

STS perspectives on maintenance further elucidate how artifacts’ temporalities—entangled with the careers, identities, and expectations of those maintaining them—are central to sustaining functionality over time (Cohn, 2019, cite). This body of work underlines the labor-intensive processes of adapting and negotiating systems, particularly legacy infrastructures that resist straightforward modernization​. Similarly, studies of software maintenance emphasize the collaborative and evolving nature of sustaining "common knowledge" within organizations, as breakdowns often necessitate creative reconfigurations across “multiple scales of action” that reveal the relationality of technological systems (Ribes and Figolt). Our study builds on this foundation by focusing on transit operators’ dual role as maintainers of technological systems and customer-facing service providers. These operators frequently encounter and mitigate breakdowns, embodying "repair-as-maintenance" while navigating the limits of "repair-as-transformation" (Sims & Henke, 2016). Unlike studies centered on maintenance staff or repair specialists, we explore how transit operators balance immediate repair needs with broader operational and passenger management responsibilities.

This work contributes to ongoing discussions in HCI and CSCW by highlighting the intersection of technical breakdowns, infrastructural aging, and the lived practices of repair within dynamic, safety-critical environments. Through this lens, we extend the study of repair and maintenance to address the everyday practices that sustain transit systems under conditions of recurrent failure.
METHODS
This paper builds upon a larger study around the daily experiences of transit bus operators to understand how potential future technologies and automation will impact their work. To arrive at the analysis featured in this paper, our research team partnered with two international transit labor unions to develop and conduct a diary study [cite] with North American transit operators over the course of one year, from Spring 2023 - Spring 2024. We chose the diary study method to collect data that would give a longitudinal perspective on transit operations, given that each day new situations arise and patterns may exist depending on the time of day, week, or year. The diary study method also allows for operators to document situations that occur soon after they experience them, documenting details that could be lost over time. The longitudinal data collection also allowed our team to learn about adaptations or changes in work that may occur over time due to different situations. Lastly, working with the transit labor unions, we learned that some operators keep a work diary, thus, the method would likely be either familiar or acceptable to the participants. To supplement the diary study data and collect more information, we also conducted semi-structured interviews with operators who agreed, asking follow-up questions based on their diary entries. In this paper, we focus on operators' entries and interviews surrounding the tools, technology, and equipment that impact their work.
Participants
With support from our union partners, 155 operators signed up for our study, 93 of whom submitted entries. Operators came from major regions of the U.S. and Canada representing urban, suburban and rural municipalities. Due to the sensitive nature of having operators describe their day-to-day work, we did not collect detailed demographic information, however, our participants are generally representative of the overall bus operator population regarding race, gender, and age. The participants pool includes operators with varying years of experience, ranging between 0-48 years across the 68 operators who responded to this question. The majority of participants were from the U.S. as Canada represents a smaller market. 
Diary Study and Interview Procedures
Participants completed the diary study via a digital Qualtrics questionnaire that allowed them to either write or record a video response to four questions. Each diary entry asked operators about 1) assisting passengers, 2) noteworthy situations, 3) the impact of tools, technology, and equipment, and 4) any other things they would like to communicate with our research team. The diary study was designed to be answered at the end of an operator’s work day. Participants chose to receive either text message or email reminders to complete a diary entry. Participants selected what days and times to receive these reminders during an onboarding questionnaire that collected basic information about the participant and provided a short guide on completing diary entries. The four diary questions were intended to be answered within ~15 minutes. Operators were compensated weekly with a gift card valued at $7.50 for each entry they submitted.

Participants were asked to complete 30 entries over 60 days, however, not all participants completed 30 entries due to the time commitment and extenuating circumstances at their jobs. We invited participants who had submitted entries and were enrolled for at least 60 days to participate in the follow-up interview, with 47 agreeing. To inform each interview, our research team reviewed the participant’s diary entries and compiled a list of specific follow-up questions. We also asked a set of background questions to understand the operator’s daily work, experience, and vehicle. Interviews were conducted over video conference and recorded with the participant’s permission. During the interview, one research team member led while another listened and took notes. Interviews lasted 90 minutes on average, with some being conducted over a few days due to participants' time constraints and their eagerness to describe their work and experiences in detail. One interview was conducted via written communication over email at the request of the participant. Participants were compensated with a gift card at a rate of $30 per hour after completing the interview.
Data Analysis
Overall, the data includes roughly 2000 diary entries answering the four daily questions either as written answers or participant recorded videos and over 100 hours of interview audio recordings. Video recorded diary entry audio and interview audio was machine-transcribed and later reviewed by our team and updated for accuracy. Text from the diary entries was reviewed in an ongoing manner to prepare for interviews and to provide updates to our transit union partners during bi-monthly meetings. All text-based data was then uploaded to Atlas.ti, a qualitative coding tool. The data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach [cite]. Emerging themes were discussed and reviewed during weekly research team meetings. This paper focuses on themes relating to the technologies bus operators reported using and their impact on their work and operations experiences. These include firsthand reports of how different technologies impact service and safety, how operators respond to technical breakdowns and issues through adaptation and problem solving, and operators’ thoughts on future training, maintenance, and operator-informed systems design.
FINDINGS
Our findings reveal the everyday breakdown that bus operators experience on the road. While minor issues are frequent, more severe problems that leave buses inoperable are not uncommon. These range from small annoyances that can distract operators, such as flashing dashboard lights, to radio malfunction, to dramatic engine fires. There are many mechanical systems and digital technologies that can go awry. We detail their importance to maintaining smooth service and accessibility while also revealing the challenges that come with their failure. In doing so we point to on the ground workarounds bus operators develop to patch over being left to their own devices. 

Many bus operators pride themselves on being skilled professionals who can resourcefully and dynamically handle challenging situations. This was readily apparent with Operator TO-503. He’s the guy supervisors ask for help if there’s a mechanical issue and other drivers turn to for advice. Operator TO-503 even compared himself to the fix-it genius of the 1980s self-titled TV series “MacGyver.” Before becoming a bus operator he was a tow truck operator and he regularly helped out drivers who needed a lift or a small repair. He took pride in troubleshooting issues to help get folks on their way. He took this knowledge with him when he began his career in transit, now also helping folks get where they need to go across the greater Ontario area. He carries zip ties and duct tape in his work bag and feels comfortable fixing small issues without asking for help from the mechanics in the yard. Lots of our participants had prior background in jobs where some mechanical knowledge comes in handy, as truckers, delivery workers, and more. But this is certainly not all drivers. Others were weary about taking on maintenance tasks and worried about role creep. They argue that doing the incredibly intensive work of safe driving and providing quality service should be enough. For them it was also about professionalism and dignity, being provided with a safe work environment and tools they need for success. 

Transit workers pointed to the systemic causes of disrepair and too often feeling pushed to drive in unsafe conditions. Many suggested that they do not have adequate time to inspect vehicles during their pre-trip and are encouraged to just keep moving instead of sending a bus back into the yard. Our participants also expressed sympathy with and respect for their mechanics. But at many agencies they are understaffed and under-resourced. This leads to needed repairs taking longer and the in practice minimum vehicle safe standard being lowered. Due to explicit federal regulations, this same dynamic would not be tolerated in other transportation industries such as the commercial airline industry. And, while this is changing, others expressed concern that procurement was not bringing in new buses fast enough to replace an aging fleet. Over a decade, buses can go through lots of wear and tear, sometimes using roads with potholes and going through hazardous weather conditions. Together, these circumstances produce a normalized state of disrepair. We now turn to the tools and technologies bus operators utilize and worker accounts of what goes wrong. 
Operator Communication Technologies
Effective communication technologies are the backbone of modern transit operations, enabling operators to navigate complex routes, coordinate with control centers, and respond to both routine and emergency situations. Tools such as mobile data terminals, bus radios, GPS systems, and, in some cases, personal cell phones play vital roles in ensuring efficient service and passenger safety. However, while these technologies offer significant benefits—streamlining schedules, improving situational awareness, and facilitating real-time updates—they are also prone to failures and design flaws that can disrupt operations. This section examines the critical functions, challenges, and operator experiences associated with these communication tools, highlighting the ways in which they shape the day-to-day realities of transit work.

Mobile Data Terminals
Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) are essential for communication and operational updates in the transit system. These devices integrate with GPS, radios, and fareboxes, linking operators to transit infrastructure, including transit operations control centers. MDTs provide key functions such as delivering alerts about weather, road conditions, accidents, detours, and emergency situations. They also offer preemptive notifications about banned passengers, lost individuals, or those requiring assistance. Operators rely on MDTs to monitor schedules, track stops, and adjust their pace. Even experienced drivers appreciate the confirmation provided by MDTs for stops and scheduled arrival times. Additionally, MDTs help operators communicate with other buses, report when they have an overload of passengers, coordinate passenger transfers from one line to another, and support automated systems like stop announcements and route displays. MDTs also alert operators to potential mechanical malfunctions. TO-101 noted that when the MDT functions well, it “definitely makes our job easier. Especially for new operators.” TO-323 emphasized that MDTs are “such a relief to have,” helping them stay on schedule, keep passengers happy, and ensure safety. TO-748 appreciated the MDT’s feature of automatically scrolling through a list of stops as the bus passes them. Many operators also value how the timely alerts allow them to provide more comfortable, safe, and reliable service; for instance, Operator TO-748 adjusted their driving in response to a warning about steel plates in the road in order to increase passenger comfort. 
Despite these advantages, we identified 35 operators who documented issues with their MDT in their diary entries. One issue was MDT system outages, often referred to as “freezing” or “going out,” which operators attribute to aging hardware, weather conditions, or understaffed maintenance teams. Operator TO-507 mentioned their MDTs “are not working a lot of the time” and described how they followed training protocol by rejecting Control’s command to “carry on” and instead exchanging buses. Operator TO-402 stated their MDT “impedes our job,” mentioning broken promises about the deployment of more efficient electronic logbooks. Even when MDTs are operational, they may have slow boot times or connectivity issues, requiring repeated logins—a “nerve-wracking” process while driving. For example, TO-468 described their MDT taking “15 minutes to start every morning,” the entire duration allotted for pre-trip inspections. 
MDT malfunctions can compromise critical functions, such as accurate time and route displays or emergency alerts, leading to problems like incorrect stop announcements, ADA compliance issues, and passenger confusion. In response, operators rely on manual workarounds, often with support from control staff, such as re-entering data, using watches or paper schedules to track time and routes, and making verbal stop announcements. While these methods are necessary, they are inconvenient, error-prone, and introduce safety risks due to driver distractions. In more extreme cases, MDT failures may require slowing down, stopping, or even exchanging buses, further disrupting schedules. These challenges are particularly severe during emergencies, especially when a viable backup system is unavailable. TO-912 described how the failure of the “Request to Talk” button during a shift forced them to use their personal cell phone to contact dispatch. Without the phone, the operator felt that they would have been unable to contact dispatch and potentially could have faced assault from a threatening passenger. 
Although MDTs are vital to operation, poorly designed interfaces can also hinder their benefits. Some operators find that alerts become distracting and intrusive. TO-340 described the onboard technology as “too annoying,” citing an example where a control supervisor repeatedly sent messages about rain and traffic situations. TO-578 likewise recalled receiving “multiple weather-related text messages,” which were difficult to read and manually acknowledge as required while driving, forcing the operator to take their eyes off the road. Operators also noted syncing issues with MDTs during daylight savings or when deviating from regular routes. While time and schedule tracking is useful, operators reported stress caused by interfaces that highlight being behind schedule, sometimes displaying the delay in red. One senior driver expressed frustration with the design, stating that it “bothers me that it’s been designed that way, and it bothers me that some people are really, really stressed with that… I don’t think that whoever designed it thought that the little square would stress people.”
Bus Radios
In addition to MDTs, bus radios are critical tools for communication, allowing real-time coordination, situational awareness, and emergency responses. Operators use radios to receive detour instructions, traffic updates, and mechanical reports; adjust schedules and routes; and share information with other operators. TO-843 with ulcerative colitis emphasized the importance of open communication for bathroom-related schedule changes, explaining, “If I’m taking a lot longer than just a few minutes, I will call them and say, ‘Hey, listen, I’m in the washroom. This is where I am. I just need a few extra minutes.’” Radios also provide situational updates on environmental and infrastructure issues, such as road closures, accidents, and hazardous weather. For example, TO-536 recounted using the radio to report icy road conditions and warn other drivers. Radios also help manage passenger logistics, such as coordinating transfers, handling overcrowded buses, and assisting when buses break down.
However, radio systems face connectivity and reliability challenges. Operators reported instances of driving entire shifts without communication with dispatch due to radio failures. Operators noted these failures seem linked to outdated technology and buses, though even newer buses sometimes experience issues. Signal loss and static occur also cause issues with distorted or inaudible communication. Operator TO-730 noted, “When I was out in the far end of the city, all I heard on an all-call was static. This is an everyday occurrence.” In fallback modes, where communication is limited to a public broadcast channel, operators lose direct contact with dispatch. Operator TO-229 explained how fallback mode means “you can hear everybody’s conversation over the radio,” which can lead to situations of confusion when operators are not certain who dispatch might be responding to. 
GPS Integration 
Operators also described how radio and GPS issues can compound each other. Operator TO-101 explained that when GPS becomes unsynced, control must call to establish bus status, which is “frustrating when mixed with our radio issues…whether or not control can hear us through our headsets.” Operators reported GPS-related challenges similar to personal vehicles, such as geolocation and routing errors, but with added bus-specific constraints like avoiding residential areas. TO-503 noted GPS systems “guide cars and don’t account for large vehicles,” recounting a time they avoided “a side street that you had no business taking a bus down.” TO-578 stated such errors can get “people in big doo doo with one wrong turn.” These issues are worsened by external factors like road conditions, e.g., broken-down cars, construction barriers, and highway pylons (TO-314). Operators also described limited GPS functionality—lacking real-time traffic updates, turn-by-turn navigation, detour integration, and detailed street-level information. TO-976 highlighted that while experienced operators rely less on GPS, it can assist with “nooks and crannies or some road closures.” TO-496 used GPS primarily for schedule and head sign updates rather than navigation. However, robust GPS becomes vital under challenging conditions. For example, TO-309 noted the difficulty of memorizing up to nine detours and 19 routes during “construction season,” compounded by short winter daylight hours, and TO-503 described using GPS to find an exit in thick fog. 
Cell Phones as Stopgap
Cell phones have emerged as an alternative during breakdowns of communication or navigation technologies, with 33 operators in our diary study describing cell phone use. Operator TO-843 described a representative experience of having to call from their cell phone because they “only had one bus this week where my radio was working.” Beyond addressing direct technological failures, operators use their cell phones’ ability to access–in timely and responsive ways–real-time information and communication to assist passengers, verify information, and respond to emergencies. TO-182 described using their cell phone to help a passenger with a wheelchair transfer, stating, “I quickly realized he needed a different bus, but didn’t immediately know which, so got off the bus and appropriately used my cell phone to find out for him.” Several operators also described asking passengers who need language assistance to speak into language apps on their phone–though they note this behavior is not allowed. TO-340 lamented, “We could be more helpful if we were allowed to use our cell phones to look up addresses that customers are searching for,” since MDTs often do not offer GPS navigation.
Operators also spoke of using phone apps for weather updates, real-time traffic data, and communication with colleagues about route changes and detours. TO-578 described saving “about half an hour” by using a traffic app to reroute, expressing frustration with the “15-20 minute” delay in traffic updates from control. Cell phones were also critical in emergencies, as operators viewed them as more reliable than radios. Operators TO-724 and TO-410 likened contacting control to “a luck of the draw” or “50-50 chance,” with TO-806 recalling how they called 911 instead of transit police for a passenger emergency where “every second counts.” Cell phones were also used to document dangerous passenger behavior (TO-507). However, restrictions on phone use created tension. Operators faced challenges when unable to leave their seats or when cell signals were weak, and disciplinary policies penalized phone use, even when it aided operations. TO-783 noted suspensions for phone use, while TO-340 criticized the reliance on outdated MDTs and handsets, contrasting them with personal devices that offered “more detailed and accessible resources.” They described these policies as “unfair,” reflecting systemic gaps where operators strove to meet passenger needs but lacked adequately maintained or integrated tools.
Passenger-Facing Technologies
Passenger-facing technologies play a critical role in maintaining smooth transit operations and supporting passenger needs. Included in this category are fare machines, announcement systems, stop signals, and accessibility tools, which often suffer from hardware and software malfunctions, poor design choices, and cascading failures that create challenges for operators and passengers alike.
Communication Systems
Passenger communication technologies include tools like announcement systems, display systems, and bell systems performing essential functions. Announcement systems provide live and pre-recorded messages about upcoming stops, route details, and important policies, while display systems present information about the next stop, and bell systems allow passengers to request stops in a timely and audible manner. These tools are vital for passenger navigation, particularly for those unfamiliar with routes or with visual or hearing impairments, while also reducing operators' cognitive load. TO-182 noted, “Four riders with visual impairments boarded my bus at the same stop, and so I was glad that my overhead announcer was working properly to keep them informed of the bus location... We are able to manually announce the stops as well, but it is nice to have that variable, and distraction, removed from our list of things we have to focus on.”

However, breakdowns in communication systems create significant challenges. Failures in these tools often force operators to provide manual input, increasing their cognitive load and the risk of conflict with passengers. Operator TO-584 reported, “too often, the bell chimes when NOT pushed, then won’t chime when the passengers push it,” describing how this malfunction, coupled with the Stop Requested sign being positioned behind the driver, resulted in them being yelled at for missing a stop. The problem lasted for 8 hours. These failures lead to unnecessary stress, delays, and, at times, strained interactions between operators and passengers.
Fare Payment Systems
Fare payment systems encompass cash, tap-enabled cards, mobile apps, and machine-issued tickets, performing essential functions like processing payments and printing transfers. Many operators noted liking these systems relative to older methods (a notable departure from Prichard et al.’s findings [cite]), but also described fareboxes rejecting wrinkled bills, failing to process tap payments, or going offline entirely. We identified 44 operators who documented problems with their fare payment equipment. For instance, TO-323 noted, “The farebox was not taking tap cards and was only taking bills and coins. Due to [the] farebox being really slow, this affected me during my second trip. I let passengers ride for free after the farebox completely froze.”

Design and placement flaws exacerbate these challenges. Operator TO-489 described how a card reader that faced passengers rather than the driver caused confusion, as passengers assumed it was functional even when it wasn’t. In response, the operator creatively used a garbage pail to signal its dysfunction. TO-584 recounted a situation where a farebox, left full for a week, nearly led to a conflict when a customer attempted to take money from it. Operator TO-930 explained how QR scanning can fail due to environmental factors like bright sunlight and passenger difficulties in aligning their phones correctly or adjusting the screen brightness. Operators also face additional burdens educating passengers unfamiliar with payment systems, such as out-of-town passengers assuming their credit cards would work or misunderstanding tap-to-pay requirements.

These failures are not merely technical but also behavioral. Passengers occasionally expect fareboxes to dispense change or assume insufficient funds errors are immediate rather than tied to delayed bank transfers. Operators often mitigate these challenges by troubleshooting issues themselves, providing free rides to prevent delays or conflict, and offering guidance to passengers on system use. For instance, Operator TO-501 assisted a passenger confused about the underpayment status of their tap card and offered a free ride, hoping their small action helped the individual better navigate the system. Yet, failures in fare payment systems can lead to delays, passenger frustration, and even violence—fare disputes are a leading cause of conflicts between passengers and operators [cite]. While operators frequently absorb the burden of these failures to ensure smooth service, they express concerns about systemic issues, such as outdated equipment, inadequate maintenance, and limited accessibility of new payment methods. 
Accessibility Equipment Failures
Similar to payment technologies, ramps, lifts, and wheelchair straps are critical to ensuring bus transit remains accessible to passengers. We identified 28 operators who documented problems with their accessibility equipment. Operators frequently reported facing failures like stuck ramps and straps, compounded by design flaws that poorly accommodated diverse mobility devices or required manual intervention. TO-182 found it “frustrating” when equipment failed and “embarrassing when a customer needed to ride and was unable to because of faulty mechanics.” TO-915 called for wider lifts and doorways, noting “there’s no room for error,” while TO-241 recounted a wheelchair user nearly tipping off a ramp.

The equipment failures described by operators often undermined passenger autonomy. TO-748 described a passenger unable to secure their wheelchair due to stuck straps, and TO-932 criticized a locking strap design that prevented users from strapping in independently, saying, “They hate it. I don’t blame them.” These issues also increased risks for operators. TO-190 noted, “If straps are not secure and a customer falls, that’s on the bus operator.” TO-986 and TO-748 described breaking policy to assist passengers with ramps that were too steep or narrow, citing risks of injury or unsafe traffic conditions. TO-314 wrestled with helping passengers without straining themselves, and TO-584 highlighted dangers of exiting the bus in traffic to assist riders.

Even functional equipment caused delays due to slow operation or inconsistent designs. TO-748 noted a new harness system that delayed them by two minutes and other operators emphasized the stress of keeping schedules, as TO-394 summarized, “Seconds mattered because we had to stay on time.” Delays often cascaded, with TO-314 explaining, “Getting stuck behind buses deploying their ramp caused delays.” When failures occurred, operators often troubleshot creatively. TO-309, for example, used “creative mechanical maneuvers” to address a ramp failure on a hospital run. Despite their expertise, operators faced challenges balancing passenger needs, safety, and accountability when deploying existing accessibility equipment.
Bus Mechanics and Operations
Beyond the digital technologies in the bus, operators described many physical systems that could fail and impact bus operations and passenger experience. These include the engine, doors, HVAC, operator controls, sensor systems, and new battery-electric buses. The failures and challenges described across these technologies give an overview of how core physical systems in a bus may require consideration when designing and deploying new systems.
Mechanical Failures and Safety Risks
Transit operators noted facing persistent mechanical issues, including overheating, coolant leaks, and sudden shutdowns, which jeopardized safety and operations. One alarming incident involved TO-402, who documented an engine fire and reported, “My transit authority encourages us to put out the fire, putting us at risk!” TO-748 highlighted another concern, recalling that the first bus they attempted to use had a jammed fire extinguisher box, emphasizing the critical importance of equipment readiness in emergencies.

Numerous other operators described breakdowns and mechanical failures as routine. We identified 45 operators who documented a bus breakdown or mentioned needing to exchange their bus. TO-986 recalled weeks where “half of the days I’ve worked, I’ve driven a bus off the lot that I needed to swap out and call back in for some particular mechanical issue.” Operators also described bus swaps as failing to resolve issues. TO-748, for example, received a replacement bus with a broken radio after returning one with faulty alarms. In another case, TO-227 transferred passengers twice during a rainstorm due to a coolant problem and foggy windshields, saying, “It was exhausting to jump from one bus to another.”

Critically, mechanical problems can escalate into hazardous situations. TO-393 reported driving a bus that lost the ability to accelerate and began rolling backward on hills. TO-468 described a bus that “died on me on the freeway,” while TO-431 avoided causing traffic congestion by pulling over after a coolant leak caused their bus to fail. These incidents strain operators’ interactions with passengers. TO-779 explained, “When things break down and it’s not the norm for passengers, you can tell they panic… asking lots of questions about timing points and [if] the bus is still continuing.”
Braking, Performance, and Operator Adaptation
Operators also reported having to adapt to braking and performance issues in older buses. TO-394 recounted compensating for fading brakes on an aging bus by creating extra stopping space, which disrupted schedules. TO-518 continued driving a bus with poor braking during peak morning hours, stating, “If I felt I was dangerous, I would [have] stopped driving and had a coach change.” Even after reporting issues, operators had reported having to manage until help arrived. TO-496 described driving cautiously after reporting faulty brakes and a non-working horn: “I kept the bus in service and just took my time and used extreme caution until [a replacement] arrived.” 

Proper assistance in cases of mechanical breakdown was a persistent concern among operators. TO-229 described regular issues with dashboard warnings, stating, “Maintenance came out, checked it, did what they did. It continued throughout the day. Of course, they wanted me to continue to roll.” Similarly, TO-806 recounted being instructed to park a bus back with the fleet despite unresolved transmission warnings. TO-190 emphasized the need for more personnel as response to persistent issues: “Bus maintenance is important, and I’m hoping for more people to come in to apply for the maintenance positions.”
Door Malfunctions and Operational Strain
Operators frequently also reported door malfunctions, including trouble opening and closing, erratic movement, sticking open or closed—often exacerbated by cold weather—or closing too slowly. Operator TO-482 highlighted how the back door on 60-foot buses “took an extra 30 seconds to close,” adding “10, 15 minutes to your day,” a significant operational delay. Similarly, TO-748 described an “issue with my backdoor opening and closing” that forced them to deboard passengers onto another bus. Combined with a construction detour, this caused a 10-minute delay.

Operators described triaging these failures based on urgency, safety, and passenger needs. TO-475 described how their “rear door never wanted to close,” requiring them to “pop the parking brake and put the bus in neutral,” a tedious workaround that delayed schedules and went unreported. The decision to troubleshoot independently versus seeking assistance varied. TO-915 shared how stuck front doors required a supervisor’s help, delaying their trip and adding strain on other buses. TO-932 detailed the “tricks we used, turning the air valve above the door off and on, restarting the bus, even kicking the hinge,” to fix door malfunctions. They spent 1.5 hours catching up after losing 10 minutes to these efforts, emphasizing how “no one wanted to bring a bus to their relief late and make them start the work already down on time. Very bad form.” These accounts illustrate the strain of repeated door malfunctions and the balancing act operators performed to manage service disruptions and operational expectations.
HVAC System Failures and Passenger Experience
We identified 36 operators who reported HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) issues on their buses. TO-450 described having functional air conditioning only “ten out of 30 days,” despite rarely being assigned the same bus. They attributed this to their company’s financial struggles, with “not enough buses to replace the fleet… a lot of breakdowns,” and “running with a skeleton crew” due to COVID-related absenteeism.

HVAC performance also influenced passenger behavior. Operators noted that in hot weather, some passengers rode the bus to escape the heat, while others chose buses based on functioning air conditioning or heating. Subpar HVAC systems could force an otherwise functional bus out of service, impacting passenger loads, workload, and system delays. Even when the bus remained in service, both operators and passengers faced discomfort. TO-309 describes AC not working during a heat wave, TO-536 describes having no heat on their bus in 11° F weather, while TO-668 describes having an achy body after enduring an unheated bus. Operator TO-343 highlighted how layover area regulations against idling led to 15–25 minute waits for passengers in the cold, compounding the issue.

Operators often faced passenger complaints over temperature control, despite having little control over HVAC systems. TO-340 explained how unseasonably warm weather could make buses radiate heat, and passengers wrongly believed operators controlled the temperature, sometimes accusing them of making the bus intentionally uncomfortable. TO-340 clarified, “Heat is generally under the bus hood. It is not accessible to the bus operator.” Seasonal temperature swings further heightened tensions, with TO-340 noting, “Waiting for a bus patiently in the cold does not put smiles on people’s faces.” These dynamics highlighted the disproportionate burden operators bore for system shortcomings–extending findings in other aspects of bus operations [cite] and other human-machine teaming systems [cite, cite].
Sensor Systems and False Alerts
Operators pointed out trends of noticing certain buses as being more problematic. TO-503 notes that “double deckers are notorious for having sensor troubles, where it'll tell you that an engine compartment door’s open, or a fuel cap door’s open.” Operator TO-578 mentions that “one of the unpleasant sensors is the doors in the back for the engine… if the sensor is the slightest bit dirty, it will come off on your dash and not only is it a light but it's a flashing light with an audible alarm because it's a WARNING WARNING WARNING that it picks up that the doors open in the back.” TO-748 described how the newer buses at their garage generally seem to have lots of different sensor issues–so much so that they ignore and are instructed to ignore them. For instance, this operator described “an alarm just going off for no reason… And so you just have to listen to a buzzing alarm the whole day.” In response, Operator TO-748 says that they “kind of learn to ignore it… So like, it's not sticking out to me as much….” and internalize “that one isn't real. They told me it's not real… they're like, ‘Oh, it's okay.’” Similarly, operator TO-501 mentioned learning from experience when it’s safe to reset the bus to clear weather-induced false alerts and continue driving.
Challenges with Electric Buses
Operators surfaced a variety of issues around electric bus design, maintenance, and operational performance–paralleling those in non-electric buses–which operators attribute to poor design decisions, fleet integration, and lack of maintenance, in part driven by staffing shortages. Of the 13 operators who mentioned operating electric vehicles in their diary entries, 12 surfaced operational problems. Ultimately, these failures point to missed opportunities for collaborative, operator-informed design interventions that could improve both operational efficiency, safety, as well as both passenger and driver experience. As TO-986 summed up, “the people that are creating these technologies…. Are like, kind of contorting people into them… they’ve never used it before.”

Operators surface various maintenance issues analogous to the kinds they encounter with non-electric buses. Operator TO-727 mentions that they “drove one of our brand new electric buses, and there was an endless maintenance issue with an alarm going off and an electrical warning on the dash. Eventually, I had to put the bus in the down bay at the garage and report it to maintenance.” At times, operators tried to solve the issues themselves with their expertise; operator TO-701 mentioned restarting the bus to clear a “beeping warning to shut the system down,” resulting in a delayed departure. Operator TO-359 described a battery electric bus where “when you hit the brake, the air system that controls the pressure for the braking system would leak.” They called Control, who told them to continue despite the operator’s protest about the high possibility of an accident. Operator TO-359 managed to get back safely to the yard and the mechanics by figuring out a way to “engage the pedal” to “lock the wheels and lock the motors” so “air wouldn’t leak out the back axles.” However, not all troubleshooting attempts may work: TO-467 described an incident with a “new electric bus,” after a routine shut down procedure during a malfunction, where “the bus started and took off” while passengers were on the bus–hitting four cars in the process.

Other times, reporting to maintenance for assistance may not solve the issue either. TO-229 described issues with the “check engine, stop engine, check system” that continued throughout the day despite maintenance coming out for an inspection and problems with electrical buses “shutting down for no reason.” Operator TO-986 surfaced compounding maintenance issues resulting from integrating new buses into fleets with existing maintenance backlogs. Their agency has “a bunch of new electric buses you know, which are nice,” but “on the maintenance… they're dealing with the same thing… they're short staffed, and they’re dealing with such a high volume of trying to keep these buses operational, but they're pretty beat up.” Operator TO-410 called for “bringing training in-house… [so] these mechanics can know how to fix these new [articulate and electric] buses,” but surfaced that there’s “the shortage of employees everywhere.” 

Among mechanical issues, operators primarily surface concerns around charge/range issues and their consequences. Operator TO-748 says they were “assigned an electric bus for the 2nd part of my shift today; none of the electric buses that I could have driven were charged enough. Which made me waste time going through all the different buses.” Operator TO-932 worried their charge levels would “run so low I would have to road call the bus. (Have OPS send me a different one)." Operator TO-227 worried about increased electrification of fleets without the “kind of infrastructure that would support these electric buses. Just because they have to be charged at every end, I was running at least half an hour late causing inconvenience not only to the passengers but my fellow operator.” Operator TO-727 echoed, “they keep adding these rapid transit routes… they can’t even charge the [electric] buses.” 

Weather also affects the operational abilities of electric buses, just as it does with non-electric buses. Several operators reported challenges during inclement weather. TO-229, for instance, stated that electric buses at their garage “have issues every time it rains really hard.” TO-584 mentioned that their electric bus “doesn’t detect water” in a city that “floods really easily.” Operator TO-244, working in a city with FEMA high-risk flooding zones, explained that “for electric vehicles, if there’s a problem with the battery, the bus just won’t move. The battery is supposed to be sealed, but since it’s underneath the bus, if you encounter flooding, you’d better hope it’s completely sealed, or you’ll get stuck.” TO-331 questioned the decision to purchase and use electric buses “that don’t work… in a -35 [degree] winter city” compared to diesel buses, while TO-359 reported that “in the morning my fully electric bus did not have a heater.” These accounts highlight how weather-related issues, particularly flooding and extreme cold, can significantly affect the performance and reliability of electric buses.
DISCUSSION
Designing for Infrastructural Endurance
As forms of infrastructure, transportation systems are not merely built and left to function; they require constant attention to prevent failure and to manage breakdowns when they occur. From traffic management systems to safety protocols, layers of expertise and oversight form the backbone of these networks. Yet, as operators’ accounts reveal, the endurance of transit technologies is too often maintained through a patchwork of temporary fixes and individual improvisation rather than robust systemic strategies. While the public often takes transportation systems’ reliability for granted, the reality is far more precarious. The corrosion, fatigue, and breakdown of infrastructure exposes its vulnerability, with each failure accumulating “accretions”—evidence of ongoing repairs, expansions, and adaptations [cite]. These processes of decay and renewal are essential for infrastructural endurance, yet they remain largely invisible [cite].

Bus operators’ lived experiences bring the instability of infrastructure into sharp relief. Operators’ adaptive strategies in response to malfunctions—using personal cell phones during radio failures or deploying manual solutions for inadequate wheelchair ramps—underscore their critical role in sustaining transit systems. These responses illustrate a broader truth about infrastructure: its functionality often hinges not only on the systems themselves but also on the human labor that supports them [cite,cite]. This work is not easy. Constantly having to respond to failures places a considerable mental burden on operators. This burden compounds the complexity of their already demanding tasks and becomes a psychosocial hazard, contributing to job stress and fatigue. 

Operators navigate infrastructure that is simultaneously an “engine and barrier for change” [cite]. On one hand, technologies like MDTs provide critical tools for managing transit. On the other, their frequent malfunctions add layers of complexity, with operators forced to absorb the operational strain. This tension mirrors broader systemic challenges: while investments often prioritize new technologies, the existing systems they depend on are neglected, undermining both current operations and future innovations [cite]. Furthermore, new technologies can interact in unexpected ways with existing systems and human processes, potentially leading to degradation in service or stress for operators, similar to previous findings by Pritchard et al. around location-based services [cite] and digital payment systems [cite]. However, where Pritchard et al. emphasize concerns from drivers about surveillance and increased managerial control [cite], we find that bus operators often feel abandoned to deal with a normalized state of disrepair.

However, these insights are frequently overlooked in favor of experimenting with unproven models. The push to introduce automation, for example, proceeds without addressing the structural breakdowns in legacy systems [cite]. This approach risks exacerbating the very vulnerabilities it seeks to solve. Instead, understanding transportation infrastructure as a process rather than a product shifts attention to the second-order systems essential for its endurance. The expertise required to monitor, maintain, and repair transit systems forms an often-invisible layer of resilience. Yet, as operators’ experiences demonstrate, this resilience is increasingly strained by understaffed maintenance teams, aging fleets, and a lack of investment in foundational systems [cite, cite]. What, instead, if we took seriously the duty to uphold existing infrastructures? By prioritizing repairability and attending to the breakdowns revealed by operators, we could foster innovations grounded in the realities of transit operations. Designing resilient transit systems is necessarily about ensuring the well-being of those who operate them.
From Ad Hoc Solutions to Resilient Design
A focus on the temporality of transportation infrastructure—acknowledging that even well-designed systems are subject to wear and breakdown—offers us an opportunity to reconsider the role of maintenance and repair. Operators' accounts reveal gaps in system design and highlight areas where incremental improvements could significantly enhance the resilience of transit systems. For example, designing technologies with greater repairability and robustness in mind could reduce reliance on ad hoc solutions and promote long-term system sustainability — improving both passenger experience and operator well-being.

This lens helps us shift focus toward recurring breakdowns in transit, where failures not only affect operational safety but also demand immediate attention from drivers. Operators frequently solve problems on the fly while managing passengers and maintaining service schedules. Despite official policies, many operators use their personal phones to access information that helps resolve issues on the road, such as finding answers for passengers or communicating with dispatch. This practice highlights an important point: operators, in many cases, have found ways to bridge gaps in the system. Their resourcefulness speaks to a need for a more adaptable, integrated approach to problem-solving—one that incorporates the tools they already use and value. As Vertesi’s [cite] concept of “seams” suggests, complex infrastructures often require careful coordination between disparate systems. Operators, in particular, play a crucial role in stitching these seams—aligning various components of the system in ways that allow it to function, even when things don’t go as planned. Their ability to manage these misalignments in real time underscores the importance of designing transit technologies that are not only user-friendly for passengers but also accessible and adaptable for the people who keep the system running.

The sociotechnical nature of repair reminds us that sustainability in transit systems is not about aiming for flawless operation but about managing ongoing adaptations [cite]. In the words of Hollnagel, the “flexibility of human work is the reason for its efficiency,” yet this “adaptability may be taken for granted [and] non-functional conditions may become normalized” [cite]. Thus, human ingenuity is critical to complex systems and ignoring it in pursuit of new technology solutions threatens to repeat or intensify existing failures. Instead, future technology design for public transit should consider how new systems can be more easily “wrangled”, likely through thoughtful interaction design paired with new and ongoing training [cite]. This orientation acknowledges that there are no catch-all solutions to transit’s challenges. Instead, we should prioritize investments that focus on improving system reliability, maintenance, and the integration of operator expertise. 
CONCLUSION
This research sheds light on the crucial, yet often overlooked, role of bus operators in sustaining transit systems amidst technological and mechanical failures. By centering operators’ experiences, we have sought to expose the vulnerabilities within existing transit infrastructure, where breakdowns in radios, mobile data terminals, fare payment systems, and accessibility tools compromise safety, efficiency, and worker well-being. Operators’ adaptive strategies, such as developing creative workarounds for malfunctioning equipment, underscore their resilience but also reveal systemic gaps in technology design and maintenance. As the transit industry accelerates its adoption of new technologies, including electrification and driver-assistance systems, our findings highlight the importance of integrating operator insights into design and implementation processes. Neglecting foundational systems and the lived realities of frontline workers risks amplifying existing challenges and undermining the potential of new innovations. We call for a recalibration of priorities in transportation planning and computing research. Rather than viewing aging infrastructures as obstacles to be replaced, we should recognize their potential as foundations for adaptive and inclusive innovation. The lessons of infrastructural endurance invite us to envision a future where repairability is central to transit design. By attending to the breakdowns revealed through operators’ accounts, we can prioritize systems that are not only functional but resilient, and acknowledge the critical labor of those who sustain these systems.
